# Getting Started

This [React Web Application](https://react.dev/), built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## NodeJS installation

First, download NodeJS v20.11.1 (during installing please allow NodeJS added itself to PATH automatically):

```
https://nodejs.org/dist/v20.11.1/node-v20.11.1-x64.msi
```

Check NodeJS if it's installed successfully through cmd/terminal:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

## Starting React Web Application

Using cmd/terminal, go to root dir at frontend/ and run this command:

```bash
npm install
```

Finally, run the development server using either one of these command:

```bash
# Use this command if you install with npm (default)
npm run dev 
# Use this command if you install with yarn
yarn dev 
# Use this command if you install with pnpm
pnpm dev 
# Use this command if you install with bun
bun dev 
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
